# LIVE LIKE A LOCAL
Making you feel at home in the beyond!



## MVP

* To create a full stack app, with user authentication. 
* Geolocation Tracker, giving you a view of local activities. 
* Allow users to favourite places they've been or where they want to go
* 70% test coverage 
* Custom CSS 

Stretch goal is to allow users post photos of places they think others will like, linked to the co-ordinates, so these can show up on a public page
Create an ML collaborative recommender model to suggest where they user should go next, what they might like etc
